Design Choices
I wanted to make sure to account for non-numeric inputs and inputs that are greater than the data's
length. I decided to send the whole data set if either of these conditions were met, however, I may
want to reconsider sending all of the data if I had a larger data set. Also currently the returned facts
are not random and always start from the first element in the data array. This can be achieved relatively
easily.

Challenges Faced
Not many, deciding the best way to handle invalid input gave me the most pause, but I am satisfied with
my solution.
